<para id="element-916">Teachers can integrate Kidspiration into every aspect of their curriculum because it allows for incorporation of visual learning throughout your lesson plans. There are several ways to use Kidspiration in the classroom when teaching Language Arts. Kidspiration provides a variety of helpful ways to organize stories, work on phonemic awareness, learn how to write more efficiently, and many more options. The Kidspiration website also makes it easy for classroom teachers to attend to their state standards because there is a “standards matches” page providing every state’s standards.  

   </para><para id="element-505">http://www.inspiration.com/Standards-Matches/Kidspiration</para><para id="element-42">Kidspiration provides students with visual learning that is proven to improve their conceptual knowledge of subjects. The different views allow students in the classroom to see things in pictures and words using graphic organizes and in integrated writing view they build on letter and word skills. The symbol categories are aligned with K-5 curriculum so they are always focused on relevant information. Kidspiration is innovative because it combines student’s visual thoughts with written expression. The symbols are paired with their words to strengthen student’s literacy.</para><para id="element-469">Some potential problems could be students need to be familiar with how the program works in order to learn it efficiently. A teacher would need to have a lot of time that they could dedicate to using the Kidspiration program so students become familiar with what the icons mean and are able to use it on their own successfully. Teachers also need to know the answers to the lesson they are teaching because Kidspiration does not correct wrong choices made. Students and teachers are responsible for making all of the corrections on the website.

<para id="element-461">•	The official website provides several good examples of how Kidspiration can be introduced and utilized in the classroom. A good example is called “Writing my First Report”, this lesson provides students with the opportunity to organize their thoughts and begin the writing process. The students are asked to read a book about and animal and then they are asked to create a web including where the animal lives, what it eats, how it moves and  how it reproduces.  Students fill in these categories and use them to organize and develop a simple essay. After the “picture view” is complete switch to the “writing view” and the teacher aids students in creating complete simple sentences.

The teacher starts by reading several different versions of the fairy tale Goldilocks and the Three Bears. Students are going to compare and contrast versions of the same story,  describe characters and setting, and use supporting details to identify 
and describe main ideas, characters and setting. The first activity involved a simple character template which is used to describe the character in Abuela and the Three Bears. The students then read “Somebody and the Three Blairs” and complete a comparison stories template. The students have an opportunity to be creative and create an alternate ending to the stories.  The finally Kidspiration tool used is the story element activity where they combine skills to compare and contrast setting, characters and plot.

As students become more confident and capable they use certain strategies that aid  them inhow to be a good reader. One of these important strategies is for readers to ask questions before, during, and after reading the text.  A good example of using Kidspiration to utilize this strategy is found at the website listed below.  Teachers have the opportunity to model a question web allowing students to ask questions before, during, and after a story.   After reading the selection teacher can go over how questions were answered in the text.  Teachers may use this activity for guided practice of allow students to complete the question web independently while reading. </para><para id="element-11">http://www.inspiration.com/LessonPlan/Question</para><para id="element-954">•	Students can use a Venn Diagram to practice their rhyming words. In this example students read Green Eggs and Ham by Dr. Seuss. They are asked to think about the rhyming words. Students then use Kidspiration to complete their Venn Diagram independently. Teacher checks work, prints out finished diagram and include it in their Language Arts journal for rhyming practice. </para><para id="element-94">http://www.lessonplanspage.com/LACIMDRhymingWordsGreenEggsAndHam1.htm</para><para id="element-932">•	In second and third grade students are all working on improving their comprehension. Kidspiration offers a way to organize your thoughts and information about a story. The title and author of the story should go in the center. Students can summarize the plot in the “What is happening in the story” section.  Other categories could include “What is the writer trying to say?” “Who are the main characters?” and “Where does the story take place”. In the web there will be a combination of pictures and text. When you switch to the writing view there are more details about each subject. This can help students to analyze what they have read and review between readings. A good example can be found here: </para><para id="element-724">If you go to this website and click on The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe example at this link...
http://www.inspiration.com/Examples/Kidspiration#Reading_and_Writing</para><para id="element-980">•	Kidspiration can also be very helpful for teaching word study. In this lesson the teacher is focusing on the “ea” sound. The students will work together and they will get to see many words in the "ea" sounds. The students will explore the words and discovery how many different sounds and words these vowels are in. The partners will match the object to the matching sounds using Kidspiration. On their worksheets, students will get to write down all the words that they heard on Kidspiration. Kidspiration is an organized and easy way to allow all children to hear the sounds and develop a letter/sound connection. </para><para id="element-529">http://www.lessonplanspage.com/LACIKidspirationEASounds12.htm</para></section><section id="element-71"><title>Tips for Teachers</title>
