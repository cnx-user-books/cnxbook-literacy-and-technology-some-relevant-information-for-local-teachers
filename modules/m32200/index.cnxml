      <title>What is a Podcast?</title>
      <para id="id10588604">The word podcast is a play on the word broadcast combined with the word iPod, says Jason Van Orden at <link url="http://www.how-to-podcast-tutorial.com/what-is-a-podcast.htm">http://www.how-to-podcast-tutorial.com/what-is-a-podcast.htm</link></para>

        <title>Where can I download podcasts?</title>
        <para id="id10568065">Podcasts can be and are about just about anything and everything. One of my favorite sites, and certainly a possible source for educational materials is at <link url="http://www.npr.org/rss/podcast/podcast_directory.php">http://www.npr.org/rss/podcast/podcast_directory.php</link></para>
        <para id="id10578366">The Education Podcast Network <link url="http://epnweb.org/">http://epnweb.org/</link> has many student and teacher created podcasts from all grade levels and subject matters to peruse.</para>

      <title>How Do I Create a Podcast?</title>
      <para id="id10658934">There are several different options with which to begin creating a podcast. Sites such as <link url="http://www.audacity.sourceforge.net/">http://www.audacity.sourceforge.net/</link> have free, open source software that anyone can use to record, download, and alter audio files, including MP3 and WAV. With audacity, you can not only create new audio files, you can import pre-existing files and edit, splice, and add effects to make your podcast more interesting or individualized. Audacity is a type of freeware: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeware</para>
      <para id="id10474069">Once audacity has been downloaded, there are few simple steps to follow to create a podcast. Audacity has its own wiki site, at: <link url="http://wiki.audacityteam.org/index.php?title=Tutorials">http://wiki.audacityteam.org/index.php?title=Tutorials</link></para>
      <para id="id10449305">The wiki has detailed tutorials on just about anything you can do with audacity. </para>

      <para id="id10449664">Once you have created the podcast, you can use a free blogger site like Google blogger <link url="http://www.blogger.com/">www.blogger.com</link> to host your podcast. Blogger is free, but there are other sites where you can pay to have your podcasted hosted and stored.</para>

        <para id="id10968054">Here, another teacher creates his own podcast to instruct students in all sorts of things, including, in one case, coordinating and subordinate conjunctions. Although the material is rather dull, the teacher makes attempts to use humor and movie clips to appeal to students. For instance, the voice that introduces the podcast sounds like a high-brow British professor, although the teacher himself has no such accent. He uses an audio clip of star wars to illustrate independent clause usage. The podcast is certainly informative.</para>
        <para id="id10755184">The teacher also elaborates on students’ in class assignments in some podcasts.</para>

        <para id="id10469770">3. A student could make a podcast about their favorite book, or they could act out a scene from their favorite play. Teachers can create podcasts on their own for use in the classroom, or for students to use while at home. </para>
